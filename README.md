## What are tags?

HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML, used to define and structure content on a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between these tags is the element content. Some tags are self-closing.

### Some common html tags include

`<html>`: The root element that defines the entire HTML document.

`<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character set, styles, scripts).

`<title>`: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

`<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, and links.

`<h1> to <h6>`: Header tags, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` the lowest.

`<p>`: Defines a paragraph.

## What are elements?

An element refers to a complete structure that typically consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, defining the structure and content of web pages.

For example: This is a paragraph element.

> `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

And this is an image element which is self-closing

> `<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image description">`

## What are the differences between an element and a tag in HTML?

| Tags | Elements |
|----------|----------|
| Tags are the building blocks of HTML used to create elements. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. | Elements consist of both the tags and the content they enclose. An element is a complete structure within an HTML document. |
| Tags define the start and end of an element, specifying the type of content and its purpose. Example: `<a>` defines the start of a hyperlink, and </a> defines its end. | Elements represent the actual content and structure of the web page, created by the tags. Example: `<a href="https://www.example.com">`Link`</a>` is an anchor element that creates a clickable link. |
| There are two main types of tags: opening tags (e.g., `<div>`) and closing tags (e.g., </div>). Some tags are self-closing (e.g., `<img />`). | Elements can be categorized as block-level or inline, but these categories apply to the entire element, not just the tags. Example: `<div>`...`</div>` (block-level element) and `<span>`...`</span>` (inline element). |
